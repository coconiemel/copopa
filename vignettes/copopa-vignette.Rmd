)
```

```{r setup}
library(copopa)
```

The package does two things:
* It makes checking datatypes on a column in your data with a lot of values quick.
* It easily saves a dataframe into two different files, CSV and RDS.

Checking datatypes is done by the "check_type(x)" function. Enter target data and column as x and you'll receive a list of types per value.

Saving your dataframe is done by the "save_to _csv_rds(df, output_name, rownames = ...)". It requires you to enter the target dataframe, the names of the output new files and to render rownames or not (TRUE or FALSE).
